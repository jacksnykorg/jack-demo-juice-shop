The payload may be delivered by the server or other channels, but—unlike reflected or stored XSS—the server does not perform the injection/echo that triggers execution; the critical issue is a tainted data flow from source to sink within client-side logic, which traditional server-side defenses and many WAFs often miss.\n\nEffective mitigation of DOM XSS vulnerabilities requires implementing comprehensive input validation and output encoding strategies specifically designed for client‑side execution contexts. This includes establishing strict allowlisting mechanisms for user‑controllable data, implementing context‑aware output encoding based on the specific DOM operation being performed, and adopting secure coding practices that minimize the attack surface exposed through dangerous DOM/JavaScript APIs. Additionally, modern web applications should leverage Content Security Policy (CSP) directives and other browser security features to establish defense‑in‑depth protections against DOM‑based attacks.\n\nDOM XSS attacks have been extensively documented in security research and are frequently exploited to achieve various malicious objectives, including session hijacking through cookie theft, credential harvesting via phishing attacks, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users, client‑side malware distribution, and sensitive data exfiltration. The client‑side nature of these attacks makes them effective at bypassing traditional perimeter security controls and targeting users directly within their browser environment.\n\n### Types of attacks\n\n| Type                         | Source Category          | Description                                                                                                                                         | Technical Details                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **URL Parameter Injection**  | Navigation               | Malicious payloads embedded within URL query parameters that are processed by vulnerable JavaScript code accessing `location.search` or similar properties. | Commonly exploits `URLSearchParams`, direct string parsing, or framework routing mechanisms that unsafely process query parameters (including History API updates like `pushState`). |\n| **Fragment Identifier Exploitation** | Navigation       | Attack vectors utilizing URL hash fragments (`#`) that are accessible through `location.hash` and processed by client‑side routing or content loading mechanisms. | Particularly prevalent in Single Page Applications (SPAs) with client‑side routing frameworks that process hash‑based navigation.                                                       |\n| **HTTP Referrer Manipulation** | Request Context       | Exploitation of `document.referrer` values that contain malicious payloads, typically originating from attacker‑controlled websites linking to the vulnerable application. | Requires social engineering to direct users from attacker‑controlled domains with crafted referrer values.                                                                            |\n| **Browser Storage Attacks**  | Persistent Storage       | Malicious data injection into `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or IndexedDB that is subsequently read and processed unsafely by application JavaScript.    | Can persist across sessions if the attacker can get data stored (via another bug or social engineering) and may be combined with other vectors for staged exploitation.               |\n| **Cross-Frame Communication** | Inter-Frame Messaging   | Exploitation of `postMessage` APIs where malicious data is transmitted between frames or windows and processed without proper origin validation and input sanitization. | Common in applications with embedded iframes or popup windows that implement cross‑origin communication mechanisms.                                                                    |\n| **WebSocket Message Injection** | Real-time Communication | Malicious payloads delivered through WebSocket connections that are processed by client‑side message handlers without adequate input validation.         | Particularly effective against real‑time applications like chat systems, collaborative tools, or live data feeds.                                                                       |\n\n### Affected environments\n\nDOM XSS vulnerabilities can impact various categories of web applications and client‑side environments:\n\n- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** utilizing frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or custom JavaScript implementations\n- **Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)** with extensive client‑side functionality and offline capabilities\n- **Client‑side routing implementations** including hash‑based and HTML5 History API routing mechanisms\n- **Browser extensions and add‑ons** with content script injection and web page interaction capabilities\n- **Hybrid mobile applications** utilizing WebView components and JavaScript bridge implementations\n- **Rich Internet Applications (RIAs)** with complex client‑side business logic and DOM manipulation\n- **Content Management Systems (CMS)** with client-side editing interfaces and dynamic content rendering\n- **Social media platforms and widgets** implementing client‑side content embedding and sharing functionality\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n\nThis section outlines comprehensive security measures designed to prevent DOM XSS vulnerabilities through secure development practices and technical controls.\n\n### Input Validation and Sanitization\n\n- **Implement strict input validation** for all client‑side data sources including URL parameters, fragment identifiers, referrer values, storage mechanisms, and cross‑frame communications using allowlisting approaches rather than blacklisting methodologies.\n- **Establish contextual output encoding** appropriate for the specific DOM context where data will be utilized, including HTML entity encoding, JavaScript string escaping, CSS value encoding, and URL parameter encoding.\n- **Validate data origin and integrity** for cross‑frame `postMessage` communications by implementing strict origin checking and message format validation to prevent malicious data injection from untrusted sources.\n- **Sanitize persistent storage data** by validating all data retrieved from `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or other client‑side storage mechanisms before processing or rendering within the application.\n\n### Secure DOM Manipulation Practices\n\n- **Avoid high‑risk DOM sinks** including `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `document.write()`, `document.writeln()`, `eval()`, `Function()`, `setTimeout()`/`setInterval()` with string arguments when processing user‑controllable data.\n- **Utilize safer DOM manipulation methods** such as `textContent`, `createTextNode()`, and DOM element creation APIs that do not interpret content as executable code. Use `setAttribute()` only for non‑URL/non‑event attributes and never to set `on*` handlers or dangerous URL attributes from untrusted data.\n- **Implement secure templating mechanisms** using frameworks or libraries that provide automatic output encoding and XSS protection rather than manual string concatenation for dynamic content generation.\n- **Enforce separation of data and code** by avoiding the construction of JavaScript code through string concatenation with user‑controllable data and utilizing structured data formats like JSON for data transmission.\n\n### Browser Security Feature Implementation\n\n- **Deploy comprehensive Content Security Policy (CSP)** directives (e.g., `script-src`, `object-src`, `base-uri`, `frame-ancestors`) to limit script execution and reduce impact if a DOM XSS exists.\n- **Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI)** for all external JavaScript resources to prevent tampering with third‑party libraries that could introduce DOM XSS vulnerabilities.\n- **Utilize HTTP security headers** including `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, and (if CSP is not available) `X-Frame-Options`, while preferring CSP’s `frame-ancestors` directive for clickjacking protection.\n- **Adopt modern browser defenses** such as Trusted Types (where supported) to prevent assignment to DOM sinks unless passed through an approved sanitizer. Treat CORS as an access-control mechanism—not a DOM XSS control—and configure it appropriately to limit unnecessary cross-origin data exposure.\n\n### Development and Testing Practices\n\n- **Conduct regular security code reviews** focusing specifically on client-side data flow analysis to identify potential DOM XSS vulnerabilities during the development process.\n- **Implement automated static analysis** using specialized tools capable of detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities in JavaScript code and identifying unsafe data flows from sources to sinks.\n- **Perform dynamic application security testing (DAST)** with specialized DOM XSS detection capabilities and manual penetration testing to validate the effectiveness of implemented security controls.\n- **Establish secure coding guidelines** for development teams including training on DOM XSS attack vectors, secure JavaScript programming practices, and proper use of security‑focused libraries and frameworks.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","DOMXSS","Security","SourceNonServer","SourceResourceAccess","SourceNetworkRequest","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/codice/ddf/commit/a8c54db08a09e8104443fd8531c0f8b6cffda1c7?diff=split#diff-e3bb069f9efbc30d0207a7c690710bc5a3b2acac15a5b8425e622a88e63a41cdL-1","lines": [{"line": "$('#extramessage').html(decodeURIComponent(param[1].split('+').join(' ')));\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "$('#extramessage').text(decodeURIComponent(param[1].split('+').join(' '))).html();\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/Drive4ik/simple-tab-groups/commit/d23caa02378845671eb32ee2c43c368f857b47c3?diff=split#diff-efdba41d528998f946ce1103fa57532e3746b2e9b1984cb92c94a2526451aedbL-1","lines": [{"line": "document.getElementById('title').innerHTML = title || url;\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "document.getElementById('title').innerText = title || url;\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/mykter/TagTime-desktop/commit/684351457a3299047fa60563785aa1716df00888?diff=split#diff-821c318e2a22a1360159993ee2168341f78e7567d0b1c9996a76f3e0cfb27b26L-1","lines": [{"line": "document.getElementById(\"time\").innerHTML =\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    moment(time, 'x').format('HH:mm:ss');\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "document.getElementById(\"time\").textContent = moment(time, 'x').format('HH:mm:ss');\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 227,"cwe": ["CWE-79"]}},{"id": "javascript/HTTPSourceWithUncheckedType","name": "HTTPSourceWithUncheckedType","shortDescription": {"text": "Improper Type Validation"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "note"},"help": {"markdown": "\n## Details\n\nWhen an object is coming from `req.body` or `req.query`, coming from the express framework.

Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered.

In general, URL redirection refers to the ability of a website or application to redirect users to another site. This is often a benign and useful feature.

By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19

attack, the user can submit an SQL query directly to the database, gaining access without providing appropriate credentials.

This is one of the most commonly exploited categories of vulnerability, but can largely be avoided through good coding practices.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid passing user-entered parameters directly to the SQL server.\n* Avoid using string concatenation to build SQL queries from user-entered parameters.\n* When coding, define SQL code first, then pass in parameters. Use prepared statements with parameterized queries. Examples include `SqlCommand()` in .NET and `bindParam()` in PHP.\n* Use strong typing for all parameters so unexpected user data will be rejected.\n* Where direct user input cannot be avoided for performance reasons, validate input against a very strict allowlist of permitted characters, avoiding special characters such as `? & / < > ; - ' \" \\` and spaces. Use a vendor-supplied escaping routine if possible.\n* Develop your application in an environment and/or using libraries that provide protection against SQL injection.\n* Harden your entire environment around a least-privilege model, ideally with isolated accounts with privileges only for particular tasks.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","Sqli","Security","SourceServer","SourceHttpBody","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/andrei-tatar/HAP.js/commit/e188be46fe58a1d7f72332371b2d3b1be46b36ce?diff=split#diff-a71d0c3aa1001deb7f0c91f3dc4365d3d4714661b4e09deffdbce2e3fb606f0dL-1","lines": [{"line": "            var tableName = \"Temp\" + req.body.id;\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "            var time = Math.round(Date.now()/1000);\n","lineNumber": 8,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "            var value = req.body.temperature;\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "            db.serialize(function() {\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "                db.run(\"begin transaction\");\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "                db.run(\"create table if not exists \" + tableName + \" (time INTEGER, value REAL)\");\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "                db.run(\"insert into \" + tableName + \" values (?, ?)\", [time, value]);\n","lineNumber": 14,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "                db.run(\"commit\");\n","lineNumber": 15,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "            });\n","lineNumber": 16,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 17,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "            var device = node.device(req.body.id);\n","lineNumber": 3,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "            if (device) {\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                if (!device.init_temperature) {\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                    device.init_temperature = true;\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                    util.createProperty(device, 'temperature', req.body.temperature);\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                }\n","lineNumber": 8,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                else\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                    device.temperature = req.body.temperature;\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "            }\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/votinginfoproject/Metis/commit/a23a825a5240c28b308e51d5deced8c079483b4f?diff=split#diff-8a2ec056bc0d1ea7f81af8911eb5ed800ceb6e06ef7200bcb240e850660cc698L-1","lines": [{"line": "var query = client.query(\"SELECT * FROM results WHERE id=\" + req.query.id);\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "var query = client.query(\"SELECT * FROM results WHERE id=$1\", [req.query.id]);\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/ZeroWangZY/track-manager/commit/28b85bf6f67cfd03d6af40f35df3e9a7b21bfcd4?diff=split#diff-4271b7f8a97f7103b3b137c344e4cfe49d6bb92646f2fd31bfdba91220b45f3aL-1","lines": [{"line": "            connection.query('call gethotpoints(\\''+param.starttime+'\\',\\''+param.endtime+'\\')', function(err, result) {\n","lineNumber": 127,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "          //  connection.query('call gethotpoints(\\''+param.starttime+'\\',\\''+param.endtime+'\\')', function(err, result) {\n","lineNumber": 127,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "            connection.query('select Longtitude,Latitude from minitrack where Taxiid<10', function(err, result) {\n","lineNumber": 128,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 129,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 105,"cwe": ["CWE-89"]}},{"id": "javascript/Ssrf","name": "Ssrf","shortDescription": {"text": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "error"},"help": {"markdown": "\n## Details\nIn a server-side request forgery attack, a malicious user supplies a URL (an external URL or a network IP address such as 127.0.0.1) to the application's back end.

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser's Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they've been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser.|\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user's browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup.

The premise of the directory traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should reside. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine. The vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both client (user) machines and servers.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","ZipSlip","Security","SourceArchive","<unknown>","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/kevva/decompress/commit/?diff=split#diff-e727e4bdf3657fd1d798edcd6b099d6e092f8573cba266154583a746bba0f346L-1","lines": [{"line": "\t\t\t\tif (file === '..') {\n","lineNumber": 113,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n","lineNumber": 114,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\t\t\t\t}\n","lineNumber": 115,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 116,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "                if (self.strip) {\n","lineNumber": 117,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "                    dir = dir.slice(self.strip);\n","lineNumber": 118,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "                }\n","lineNumber": 119,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 120,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "                dest = path.join(self.path, dir.join(path.sep), file);\n","lineNumber": 121,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 122,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "                mkdir.sync(path.dirname(dest));\n","lineNumber": 123,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "                fs.writeFileSync(dest, entry.getData());\n","lineNumber": 124,"lineChange": "none"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/cmints/cmints/commit/?diff=split#diff-e6a2dd0846c99c00a2375afec88d8c46f32e19e16a19b45990634e1a7e715df9L-1","lines": [{"line": "mainEntry = path.join(\"/\", mainEntry).substr(1);\n","lineNumber": 22,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "if (!mainEntry) {\n","lineNumber": 23,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "  return;\n","lineNumber": 24,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "}\n","lineNumber": 25,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "zip.extractAllTo(tempDir, true);\n","lineNumber": 26,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "moveSync(path.join(tempDir, mainEntry), srcPath, {overwrite: true});\n","lineNumber": 27,"lineChange": "none"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/jsdevel/webdriver-sync/commit/?diff=split#diff-2ca92bd6a76d65807191414f4e67de90eb45dfc97f91f7f2036f7d0c6b6bdbeaL-1","lines": [{"line": "const safeEntry = path.join('/', entry.path).substr(1);\n","lineNumber": 95,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "if (!safeEntry || safeEntry === '..') {\n","lineNumber": 96,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "  return;\n","lineNumber": 97,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "}\n","lineNumber": 98,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "entry.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\n","lineNumber": 99,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "  path.resolve(ieConfig.binary.path, entry.path),\n","lineNumber": 96,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "  path.join(ieConfig.binary.path, safeEntry),\n","lineNumber": 100,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 30,"cwe": ["CWE-22"]}},{"id": "javascript/HardcodedNonCryptoSecret","name": "HardcodedNonCryptoSecret","shortDescription": {"text": "Hardcoded Non-Cryptographic Secret"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "error"},"help": {"markdown": "## Details\n\nWhen constants are hardcoded into applications, this information could easily be reverse-engineered and become known to attackers.

This weakness is almost completely avoidable through intelligent architecture and design.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Build web applications around a security mindset and the awareness that sniffers may be present at any time.\n* Ensure that all sensitive data transmission uses reliable encryption.\n* Implement security measures so that sensitive results are never returned in plain text.\n* Implement multiple-factor authentication methods to validate remote instances.\n* Use SSL not only at logon but throughout communications.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","HttpToHttps","Security","InTest"],"categories": ["Security","InTest"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/REBELinBLUE/deployer/commit/bdb2c9750c497c9bc025580ce5bf5b8a6972de17?diff=split#diff-112ac233b1e3314b31d86e70dd54fd358cf3e246c38a63bf2e3085a47a0d6cf3L-1","lines": [{"line": "var redis = new Redis();\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "var redis = new Redis({\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    db: ENV.REDIS_DATBASE || 0\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "});\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "if (!/^https/i.test(process.env.SOCKET_URL)) {\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 14,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    var ssl_conf = {\n","lineNumber": 15,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        key:  (process.env.SOCKET_SSL_KEY_FILE  ? fs.readFileSync(process.env.SOCKET_SSL_KEY_FILE)  : null),\n","lineNumber": 16,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        cert: (process.env.SOCKET_SSL_CERT_FILE ? fs.readFileSync(process.env.SOCKET_SSL_CERT_FILE) : null),\n","lineNumber": 17,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        ca:   (process.env.SOCKET_SSL_CA_FILE   ? fs.readFileSync(process.env.SOCKET_SSL_CA_FILE)   : null)\n","lineNumber": 18,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    };\n","lineNumber": 19,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 20,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    var app = require('https').createServer(ssl_conf, handler);\n","lineNumber": 21,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "} else {\n","lineNumber": 22,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    var app = require('http').createServer(handler);\n","lineNumber": 23,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "}\n","lineNumber": 24,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/medic/couch2pg/commit/062eaa0f53d2cd2327232a695c60bf4c9fd589f6?diff=split#diff-e727e4bdf3657fd1d798edcd6b099d6e092f8573cba266154583a746bba0f346L-1","lines": [{"line": "var httplib = require('http');\n","lineNumber": 1,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "var httplib = require('https');\n","lineNumber": 1,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/Rich-Harris/packd/commit/c14d17da80ed075ee007de3121422fb2c5b77e4d?diff=split#diff-1821d11fbffbab2187701c42616688d46bf66d7b2cf6eaf363548dd66caa6ebaL-1","lines": [{"line": "const http = require( 'http' );\n","lineNumber": 0,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "const https = require( 'https' );\n","lineNumber": 0,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 1,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "module.exports = function get ( url ) {\n","lineNumber": 2,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\treturn new Promise( ( fulfil, reject ) => {\n","lineNumber": 3,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\t\thttp.get( url, response => {\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "\t\thttps.get( url, response => {\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 122,"cwe": ["CWE-319"]}}]}},"results": [{"ruleId": "javascript/DOMXSS","ruleIndex": 0,"level": "warning","message": {"text":"Unsanitized input from data from a remote resource flows into write, where it is used to dynamically construct the HTML page on client side.
